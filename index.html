            <h3>About Torsten Maier</h3>
            <p>Over the past 4 years at the University of Evansville, I have gathered engineering experience in a variety of ways. I have gathered theoretical experience from my classes (3.85 GPA, graduated Summa Cum Laude) and practical experience from my internships. During my undergraduate career, I held three internships (one of which I am currently working at), maintained a position as a Teacher's Assistant, and have been a part of a Senior-Led Design Project each year.

            <p>My first internship was at SABIC Innovative Plastics in Mt. Vernon, IN. At SABIC, I worked in BPA (Bisphenol A) and focused on projects with long term benefits for the plant. These projects are outlined in my resume. I gained an understanding of chemical engineering, in addition to methods and practices used in the manufacturing industry. My second internship was with the Rolls-Royce Aerospace Defense Program in Indianapolis, IN. Working in Research and Component Testing I gained hands-on experience with test equipment and rigs. In my current internship at Rolls-Royce, I am working in Service Engineering for the LiftSystems (a major module of the F-35B Fighter Jets). In Service Engineering, I work directly with the customers to fix on-wing issues, repair damaged parts, and maintain air-worthiness approval. in a company that has been a frontrunner in its field for over one-hundred years.
            </p>
            <p>For my senior design project, I participated in the "NASA Student Launch Initiative." Our team designed and constructed a high-powered rocket that competed against dozens of other flight vehicles from around the country. I lead the Aerodynamics and Modeling team which was charged with 3D modeling the rocket, performing CFD simulations, and physically integrating all sections within one body.
            </p>
            <p>As for my home life, I come from a diverse family that travels often. I spent most breaks out of the country visiting family in either Ontario, Canada or Berlin, Germany. This is made easier by the three citizenships I hold (Canadian, German, and American) and being bilingual (English and German).
